Go to https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos
Right side of the page, there will be "Releases" link. Click on it.
Download Raspberri pi image. like this - motioneyeos-raspberrypi3-20200606.img.xz
Using etcher software, etch it on micro sd
Plug the Micro SD into Raspberri and boot it
First boot, we need ETHERNET cable. Then only MOtionEYEOS will boot
Default user : admin
Default password : <null>
open IPscanner tool in windows laptop (RASPBERRI PI AND WINDOWS LAPTION SHOULD BE IN SAME NETWORK..SAME WIFI)
Do search on IPs
The hostname starting with  MEYE-...   is the motioneyeos host
Take that IP and put it in browser. You can see camera preview. You can adjust to see biggere preview
Better login to change settings admin/<null>
Now enable wireless network. Give wifi credentials.Take out ethernet cable from pi. Reboot it. Your raspberri should now connect to wifi.

Port Forwarding
----------------
1. Get the ip of your wifi router.
    - Go to cmd and type ipconfig. Scoop the "Default Gateway" address and put in the browser.
    - Ex http://192.168.1.1/
2. Wifi configuration page can have authentication. For DSL-224, try admin/7035972010  user/user
Steps are in here - https://portforward.com/d-link/dsl-224/
3. Click on the User-defined Service Name radio button. Then, type in a name for this forward in the User-defined Service Name box. Choose a name that will help you remember why this forward was set up since it does not effect the functionality of the forward.
4. Select the protocol type of the ports that you are forwarding from the Protocol dropdown box. If your router has the option of Both, then go ahead and select that. Otherwise select either TCP or UDP as needed. If you need to forward a port for both TCP and UDP but your router does not have Both, then you will need to create two entries.
5. Go ahead and leave WAN Setting on Interface, then choose any from the WAN Interface drop down list.
6. If you are forwarding a single port number, enter it into the WAN Port box. If you are forwarding a range of ports, enter the lowest number of that range into the WAN Port box followed by a colon followed by the largest number. For example a range of port numbers might look like this: 1000:2000.
7. Enter the exact same values that you put in the WAN Port box, into the LAN Port box.
8. In the LAN IP Address box, enter the IP address that you want ports forwarded to. This may be the IP address of your computer or the IP address of another device on your network that you want to forward ports to.
9. When you are completely finished, click the Add button at the bottom of the page to apply these changes.



Wifi Preconfiguration
----------------
https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki/Wifi-Preconfiguration

Preconfiguring wifi is useful for loading wifi credentials into a device that does not have an Ethernet port, like the Raspberry Pi Zero or Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Wifi can only be preconfigured before the first time device boots i.e. /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf is only read once the first time device boots up. If you have booted the device with no wpa_supplicant.conf file or invalid wpa_supplicant.conf file, then you'll need to either reflash the SD card or overwrite the /data/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file.

Note: Starting from version 20190119, Wifi configuration will be read every time the device boots up i.e. existing Wifi configuration will be overwritten if /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf exists. This means there is no need to reflash the SD card if you did not get the /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf correct the first time.

From Windows
 -> Write the image to your microSD card using BalenaEtcher.
 -> Open Windows Explorer and browse to your drive containing the microSD card. You should see files such as:
       . bootcode.bin
       . loader.bin
       . start.elf
       . kernel.img
       . cmdline.txt
 -> Right-click in the right window pane and select New Text Document.
 -> Now, right click on this file and rename it wpa_supplicant.conf. Make sure to remove the .txt file extension.
 -> Once again, right click on this file and select Edit with Notepad++.
 -> Make sure you set the EOL conversion to UNIX LineFeeds (Edit-->EOL Conversion-->Unix LF).
 -> Paste the following contents into your blank file 

country=IN
update_config=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

network={
    scan_ssid=1
    ssid="Anveshan"
    psk="anveshan"
}
       
Change the country code to the country in which this device is currently operating. You can get the list of country codes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
-> Save the file. Eject your microSD card safely.
