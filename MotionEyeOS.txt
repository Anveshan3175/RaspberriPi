Go to https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos
Right side of the page, there will be "Releases" link. Click on it.
Download Raspberri pi image. like this - motioneyeos-raspberrypi3-20200606.img.xz
Using etcher software, etch it on micro sd
Plug the Micro SD into Raspberri and boot it
First boot, we need ETHERNET cable. Then only MOtionEYEOS will boot
Default user : admin
Default password : <null>
open IPscanner tool in windows laptop (RASPBERRI PI AND WINDOWS LAPTION SHOULD BE IN SAME NETWORK..SAME WIFI)
Do search on IPs
The hostname starting with  MEYE-...   is the motioneyeos host
Take that IP and put it in browser. You can see camera preview. You can adjust to see biggere preview
Better login to change settings admin/<null>
Now enable wireless network. Give wifi credentials.Take out ethernet cable from pi. Reboot it. Your raspberri should now connect to wifi.

Port Forwarding
----------------
1. Get the ip of your wifi router.
    - Go to cmd and type ipconfig. Scoop the "Default Gateway" address and put in the browser.
    - Ex http://192.168.1.1/
2. Wifi configuration page can have authentication. For DSL-224, try admin/7035972010  user/user
3.


Wifi Preconfiguration
----------------
https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki/Wifi-Preconfiguration

Preconfiguring wifi is useful for loading wifi credentials into a device that does not have an Ethernet port, like the Raspberry Pi Zero or Raspberry Pi Zero W.

Wifi can only be preconfigured before the first time device boots i.e. /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf is only read once the first time device boots up. If you have booted the device with no wpa_supplicant.conf file or invalid wpa_supplicant.conf file, then you'll need to either reflash the SD card or overwrite the /data/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf file.

Note: Starting from version 20190119, Wifi configuration will be read every time the device boots up i.e. existing Wifi configuration will be overwritten if /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf exists. This means there is no need to reflash the SD card if you did not get the /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf correct the first time.

From Windows
 -> Write the image to your microSD card using BalenaEtcher.
 -> Open Windows Explorer and browse to your drive containing the microSD card. You should see files such as:
       . bootcode.bin
       . loader.bin
       . start.elf
       . kernel.img
       . cmdline.txt
 -> Right-click in the right window pane and select New Text Document.
 -> Now, right click on this file and rename it wpa_supplicant.conf. Make sure to remove the .txt file extension.
 -> Once again, right click on this file and select Edit with Notepad++.
 -> Make sure you set the EOL conversion to UNIX LineFeeds (Edit-->EOL Conversion-->Unix LF).
 -> Paste the following contents into your blank file 

country=IN
update_config=1
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant

network={
    scan_ssid=1
    ssid="Anveshan"
    psk="anveshan"
}
       
Change the country code to the country in which this device is currently operating. You can get the list of country codes - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
-> Save the file. Eject your microSD card safely.
